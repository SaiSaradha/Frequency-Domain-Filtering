    "Discrete Cosine Transform expresses the images in terms of sum of cosine functions of different frequencies. DCT is one of the most commonly used techniques for image compression. The base of the JPEG compression technique is through DCT and we explore that by performing DCT on images. DCT is a linear invertible function and there are different variants to it, the most commonly used ones being DCT-II and DCT-III (also known as IDCT). DCT-II transforms an image block of size $N$ $\\times$ $N$ into DCT coefficients that can be expressed as:\n",

    "While the actual jpeg technique involves a lot of sophisticated techniques, it is possible to specify at a higher level, the primary steps involved in the compression. DCT is the most preferred compression transform, mainly because of the boundary behavior of cosine functions. Basically there are two major things to compression - encoding and decoding. To send the images, at the encoding side it is compressed and at the decoding side the image is reconstructed again. JPEG is a lossy compression, meaning there is some loss of information at the receiving end and the reconstructed image is not exactly the same as the original image. Steps for compression include:\n",

    "1. Choose the right color model for the image (for example YCbCr space instead of the RGB color channel).\n",
