    "Low Pass Filtering:\n",
    "Edges in an image correspond to high frequency contents of Fourier transforms. Hence, smoothing is done to cut off the high frequency components. I discuss about four major low pass filtering techniques - LPF by zeroing frequencies, Ideal LPF, Butterworth LPF and gaussian LPF. In high pass filters, we cut off the low frequency components leaving the high frequency components intact. Here again we discuss the high pass counterparts of the low pass implementations.\n",
